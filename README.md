# 3D-Plotting-with-LIDAR-Senor
 LIDAR (Light detection and ranging) is an optical detection system that works on the same principle of RADAR but uses LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) light instead of radio waves to measure the distance which is used to generate the 3D map with high accuracy of any surface. The use of LASER distance measurement system is tremendously increasing to generate the 3D map. 3D LASER mapping are a cutting edge innovator, specializing in technology to help the capture the world in 3D. In this Project, we have  completed the real time plotting of Cartesian coordinate of surrounding environment  in 3D plane. By measuring the distance with LIDAR sensor and orientation by accelerometer sensor, we are plotting by matplotlib library of python. An IMU is used to determine the attitude of the aircraft as the sensor is taking measurements. These are recorded in degrees to an extremely high accuracy in all three dimensions as roll and pitch. From these two datasets the laser beam's exit geometry is calculated relative to the Earth's surface coordinates to a very high accuracy.
